Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Hotel Booking Analysis

EDA is the first step in understanding and exploring a hotel booking dataset. This process includes summarizing the data, visualizing it with charts, and checking for missing or unusual values. Through EDA, we can spot patterns in bookings, see trends over time, and identify customer preferences.

Key tasks include:

1.Data Cleaning:- Removing duplicates and handling missing values.

2.Descriptive Statistics:- Calculating averages and spreads to understand booking trends.

3.Visualization:- Creating graphs to reveal trends, like seasonal booking patterns or types of guests.

4.Feature Engineering:- Extracting more detailed information, such as busy seasons or popular room types.

   By examining these details, hotels can adjust prices, improve marketing, and manage resources effectively. EDA helps hotels make data-driven decisions, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and business performance.
